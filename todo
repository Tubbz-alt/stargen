# Crossplatformization:
    * Functions in utils
    * 'termcolor' -> 'colorama'


# Rewrite Concept:
    * Rewrite menu structure to contain all commands from main menu - somewhat like radare2
    * introduce commands like
        "un/load" -> set current work on a particular file
        "write" -> Dump
    * this can be applied to slain as well
